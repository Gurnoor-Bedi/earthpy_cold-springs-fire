# Satellite Imagery Analysis of Cold Springs Wildfire

This project aims to analyze satellite imagery data to track changes in vegetation and understand the area and intensity of fires using Earth observation data from the Landsat program. The primary focus is on the Cold Springs wildfire that occurred near Nederland, Colorado, US, in July 2016.

## Project Goal

- Analyze Landsat satellite imagery to track vegetation changes and fire impact.
- Utilize Python libraries for Earth data analysis and visualization.

## Problem Statement

As a data scientist specializing in remote sensing data, the task is to analyze changes in vegetation affected by the Cold Springs wildfire, using Landsat imagery to assess the area and intensity of the fire.

## Dataset Description
where each component represents specific details about the satellite data (e.g., sensor used, acquisition date).

Dataset source: [Earth Analytics Cold Springs Fire Remote Sensing Data](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Earth_Analytics_Cold_Springs_Fire_Remote_Sensing_Data/6083210)

## List of Activities

### Activity 1: Import Modules and Read Data

- Import necessary Python modules.
- Download and read the Cold Springs Fire dataset.

### Activity 2: Plotting RGB Composite Image

- Plot the spectral bands of the dataset.
- Create and visualize an RGB stretched image.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- EarthPy
- Matplotlib
- Glob

## Visualization

The project involves creating visualizations such as:

- Plotting individual spectral bands.
- Generating RGB composite images to identify areas potentially affected by the fire.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install necessary Python libraries (`earthpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Run the script to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the analysis or improve the visualizations are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your changes.
